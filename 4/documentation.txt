FALoader class is the main class for the task
it has as it's members the 5-tuple typical for any FA: alphabet, states, initial state, final states and transitions
as methods, there is:

loadFromFile:
    gets as parameter the filepath and loads into memory the FA from that file

verifySequence:
    verifies if a sequence passed as parameter is accepted by the FA

displayMenu:
   show available commands

runMenu:
   take user input and execute the corresponding command

setters for the 5-tuple that take as parameter a string or a list of strings, parse the string and get the relevant data

file = alphabet
       states
       initialState
       finalStates
       transitions

alphabet = {transition }
states = letter {letter }
initialState = letter
finalStates = letter {letter }
transitions = {letter transition letter \n}

letter = 'A' | ... | 'Z'
non_zero_digit = 1 | ... | 9
digit = 0 | non_zero_digit
transition = 0 | non_zero_digit{digit}
