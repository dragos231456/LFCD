SymbolTable implemented on a hash-map
The Hash Map is esentially a list of m lists, where m is set from the start by the program.
The hash function is the result of the sum of the identifier's characters' ascii values, modulo m

The add method in the Symbol Table gets as parameter the identifier and returns it's position in the
symbol table (as a tuple)
We hash the identifier, get the corresponding position and check if the identifier already
exists in the list of the obtained position. If it does, we return the position, but if not,
we add a new position at the end of the list
